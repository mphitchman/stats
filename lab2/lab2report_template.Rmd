# Report Instructions

1.  Run the following code chunk by clicking on the green arrow in the upper right corner of the chunk. This code loads the tidyverse package and data sets used in this lab. (We note that this code chunk will not appear in your final html file when you knit the document. We make this happen with the code `include=FALSE` inside the curly braces at the top of the code chunk.)

```{r, include=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
# Data for Q1 and Q2
marbles <- rep(c("blue","orange"),c(900,1500))
# Data for Q3 and Q4
survey <- read.csv("https://mphitchman.com/stats/data/survey_cleaned_F21.csv")
```

2.  Follow the **Golden Rule of Write-ups** as discussed in the Lab 2 Instructions.

3.  You may add a code chunk at any spot of this document by following **Code -\> Insert Chunk**

4.  Email your solutions to the Lab 2 exercises in the form of an HTML or PDF file created from an *R Markdown* file in *RStudio*.
